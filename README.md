#Mastermind

#Sinatra web app to play the Mastermind game as codebreaker or codemaker. AI wins in < 7 turns in most cases at hardest difficulty. 
#Known issues: Clicking start or submit more than once sends multiple requests to write lots of data to database, causes big bugs and possible crashes. Gotta be patient.
#Also, more than one user playing the game at the same time won't work. Need to hit reset button between games for db integrity.
